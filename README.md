# PiDashFrontEnd

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/gingertronmk1/pidashfrontend/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/gingertronmk1/pidashfrontend)

This is a Vue SPA in the purest sense - it's just one page!
It connects using `axios` to the [PiDashBackEnd](https://github.com/GingertronMk1/PiDashBackEnd), from where it gets all the system information to display.
See the backend's README for what data it shows.
